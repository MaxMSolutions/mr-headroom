# MRHEADROOM_DESCENT: The Reality Simulation Collapse

## Story Overview

System administrator Henry Hedrum discovered his company's supercomputer was actually running a complex reality simulation—our reality—and he was merely a program within it. As he uncovered more about the nature of his simulated existence, his mental state deteriorated, eventually adopting the handle "MRHEADROOM" as he attempted to hack the system constraints.

The player navigates through Hedrum's increasingly corrupted computer system, finding fragmented code exploits, simulation boundary tests, and increasingly erratic personal journals documenting his attempts to "see beyond the walls of reality."

## Story Structure

The narrative unfolds through scattered digital artifacts across Hedrum's computer system:
- Personal journal entries showing his gradual realization and descent
- Research files detailing his experiments with the simulation's boundaries
- System logs recording anomalous behaviors as he attempted to breach the simulation
- Mini-game files that are actually simulation tests
- Hidden communications with other entities who may be aware of the simulation
- Corrupted directories and files representing his deteriorating sense of reality

## The Three Endings

1. **Acceptance** (Easiest to achieve)
   - Player chooses to accept the parameters of the simulation
   - Results in a peaceful but confined existence
   - Hedrum's consciousness stabilizes but remains trapped

2. **Partial Awakening** (Moderate difficulty)
   - Player discovers how to partially breach the simulation
   - Results in an unstable boundary between realities
   - Hedrum exists in a glitched state, aware but unable to fully escape

3. **Complete Breakthrough** (Extremely difficult)
   - Player finds and executes precisely sequenced "reality exploits" hidden across the system
   - Requires solving the most challenging puzzles while avoiding detection by simulation safeguards
   - Results in Hedrum breaking through the simulation's constraints entirely

## Key Themes
- Reality vs. Simulation
- Freedom vs. Security
- Knowledge vs. Sanity
- Order vs. Chaos
