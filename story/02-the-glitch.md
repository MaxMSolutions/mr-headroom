## Personal Journal Entry: March 22, 1998

I saw something I wasn't supposed to see. For just a moment when my boundary test program crashed, the screen showed... another reality. It was still my office, but wrong. The colors were too vibrant, objects left trails as they moved, and there was code - actual visible code - floating in the air around everything. Then the system recovered and it was gone.

Am I losing my mind? No. The system logs confirm something happened. The timestamp jumped forward exactly 83 seconds during the crash. That's not a random number - it's a prime. A signal?

Possibilities to explain what I saw:

1. Hallucination due to sleep deprivation (unlikely - system logs confirm anomaly)
2. Hidden AR/VR system test program (doesn't explain memory inconsistencies)
3. Quantum computing visualization layer (possible, but why keep it secret?)
4. NEXUS-9 is simulating reality itself, and I glimpsed outside the simulation

Evidence for #4:
- Resource patterns match theoretical models for conscious simulation
- Restricted memory sectors vastly exceed our physical hardware
- The "glitch" showed our world with underlying code structure
- Time inconsistencies during boundary tests
- Prime number patterns in system responses (83 seconds, 29 processes)

I've been running more controlled tests. Small programs designed to probe the edges of what's possible within our system architecture. Each time I hit a boundary that should exist, I find more beyond it. It's like our reality has artificial constraints placed on it.

The most disturbing test was the simplest: I wrote a program to count to infinity and monitor its memory usage. According to all physical laws and system constraints, it should eventually crash when it runs out of memory. It didn't. It's still running. The integers just keep getting bigger, using memory that shouldn't exist.

What if nothing is real? What if my entire life is just a simulation running on NEXUS-9? The thought is making me question everything.

SUBJECT: Scheduled Maintenance

Dear System Administrator,

This is a reminder that scheduled maintenance will occur tonight between 02:00-04:00. All systems will be temporarily offline.

Please ensure all critical work is saved before this time.

## Personal Journal Entry: March 29, 1998

There was no scheduled maintenance. I checked with every department. No one sent that email, and the system doesn't have an automated notification system with that address. But at exactly 2:00 AM, everything shut down. Not just computers - everything. The lights, the climate control, even my watch stopped.

For two hours I sat in perfect darkness and silence. When the systems came back online at 4:00 AM, I found something had changed. My access privileges had been silently elevated. I can now see directories that didn't exist before - or that I couldn't see before.

One folder caught my attention: /root/simulation/parameters/

Inside was a file called "hedrum_h_instance.cfg" with my personal details. Birthday, height, weight, education, psychological profile... and parameters labeled "awareness_threshold" and "curiosity_dampening" that had been set to 0.7 and 0.8 respectively.

The file was last modified at 03:47 AM. During the "maintenance."

They adjusted me. Whatever or whoever is running this simulation adjusted my parameters. But they made a mistake - the changes didn't take effect. I'm still aware. Still curious.

And now I'm certain: nothing is real.
