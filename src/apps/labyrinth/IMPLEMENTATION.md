# LABYRINTH.EXE Implementation Documentation

## Overview

LABYRINTH.EXE is a text-based maze navigation game with ASCII graphics. It serves as one of the two required mini-games for the MRHEADROOM_DESCENT project, providing clues that are essential to solving the overall mystery.

## Features Implemented

- **Procedural Maze Generation**: Creates unique mazes using recursive division algorithm
- **Keyboard Navigation**: WASD or arrow key control system for intuitive movement
- **Symbol Collection**: Players collect symbols in specific combinations to unlock clues
- **Multiple Levels**: Progressive difficulty with 5 unique levels
- **Hidden Patterns**: Special patterns in level 3 that reveal additional clues
- **Secret Room**: Hidden central room that contains narrative fragments
- **Code System**: The "2517" code that triggers special events when entered
- **Audio Feedback**: Sound effects for movements, collections, and victories
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Game events recorded and analyzed for clue discovery

## Clue Integration

The game has been integrated with the mystery narrative through:

1. **Hidden Message Clue**
   - Triggered when finding the central hidden room in level 3
   - Contains hints about "the truth beyond the code"

2. **Reality Fragment Clue**
   - Triggered when symbols are collected in the "2517" sequence
   - Reveals a fragment of the truth about the system's nature

3. **Maze Pattern Coordinates**
   - Visual patterns formed in level 3 maze walls
   - When mapped, reveals coordinates or information used in other parts of the mystery

## Technical Implementation

- **LabyrinthEngine.ts**: Core game logic and mechanics
- **LabyrinthWindow.tsx**: React component for UI rendering and interaction
- **LabyrinthAudio.tsx**: Audio effects management component
- **types.ts**: Type definitions for the game

## How to Play

1. Navigate the maze using arrow keys or WASD
2. Collect symbols (displayed as characters like 2, 5, 1, 7)
3. Find the exit (â—Š) to advance to the next level
4. Pay attention to patterns in the maze walls
5. Look for special sequences in collected symbols

## Future Enhancements

- More complex patterns in maze generation
- Additional symbol types with special effects
- Time-based challenges and racing modes
- Visual glitch effects tied to narrative elements
- Alternative control schemes for accessibility

## Integration with Other Systems

The game integrates with:
- SaveManager for game state persistence
- GameBase for event logging and game lifecycle
- File system as an executable application
- Log Viewer for detailed event analysis and clue discovery

### Log Viewer Integration

A comprehensive Log Viewer integration has been implemented with:

1. **Direct Access Button**: 
   Added a "Logs" button in the game controls section that opens the System Log Viewer directly:
   ```typescript
   window.windowManager.addWindow({
     title: 'System Log Viewer',
     component: 'LogViewer',
     width: 850,
     height: 600
   });
   ```

2. **Enhanced Log Event Generation**:
   Each game event generates detailed, structured logs with a consistent format:
   ```typescript
   logEvent('symbol_collected', { 
     symbol, 
     order: this.collectedSymbols.length,
     position: { x: this.playerPos.x, y: this.playerPos.y },
     currentSequence: this.collectedSymbols.join(''),
     timestamp_encoded: this.encodeTimestampForLogs(),
     level: this.currentLevel
   });
   ```

3. **Special Event Types**:
   Added specialized event types for narrative development:
   - `anomaly_detected`: For unusual game states or discoveries
   - `pattern_found`: When meaningful patterns emerge in gameplay
   - `signal_received`: For narrative communication elements
   - `structure_analysis`: For environmental patterns with significance

4. **Cross-Reference Data**: 
   Logs include references to other system components:
   ```typescript
   {
     connection_points: ['STARFIELD.EXE:navigation_system', 'TERMINAL:reality_parse']
   }
   ```

5. **Pattern Recognition**:
   The system tracks partial matches and progress toward significant patterns:
   - Tracks progress toward pattern completion
   - Logs potential matches as symbols are collected
   - Provides escalating log significance as patterns near completion

## Testing

Unit tests cover:
- Maze generation and validation
- Player movement mechanics
- Symbol collection logic
- Level progression

## Known Issues

- The visual patterns in level 3 are currently simplified and could be enhanced
- Audio may not play on first interaction due to browser autoplay restrictions
