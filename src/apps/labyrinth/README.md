- [x] Implement "secret room" discovery mechanic
- [x] Create hidden patterns in maze walls
- [x] Add special symbol combinations that reveal clues
- [x] Implement "glitch" events on specific triggers
- [x] Create logging system for player actions

### Audio & Visual

- [x] Implement visual feedback for symbol collection
- [x] Create ASCII art for game intro and victory screens
- [x] Add subtle glitch effects tied to narrative elements

### Integration
- [x] Connect game logs to the SaveManager
- [x] Set up clue discovery triggers
- [x] Link game to file system as executable
- [x] Ensure keyboard focus and accessibility
- [x] Add game to desktop and start menu
- [x] Integrate with Log Viewer for game analysis

## Implementation Summary

LABYRINTH.EXE has been fully implemented as a text-based maze navigation game with the following features:

- **Engine & Core Mechanics**: The `LabyrinthEngine` class extends the `GameBase` class and implements all core game mechanics including maze generation, player movement, collision detection, symbol collection, and level progression.

- **Procedural Generation**: Mazes are created using a recursive division algorithm that ensures proper pathways and walls, creating unique layouts each time.

- **Multiple Levels**: The game includes 5 progressive difficulty levels with increasing complexity in maze layout and puzzle mechanics.

- **UI Components**: Full React-based user interface with ASCII rendered maze, status panels, instructions overlay, and victory/game over screens.

- **Audio System**: Comprehensive audio effects for player actions (movement, collection, collision) and ambient sounds that change based on level, implemented in the `LabyrinthAudio` component.

- **File System Integration**: The game is properly linked to the RetroOS file system as an executable application through the `labyrinth_filesystem_entry.json` configuration.

- **Testing**: Unit tests cover maze generation, player movement, and game progression to ensure proper functionality.

## Clue Implementation Details

### Hidden Message in Central Room
When the player discovers a secret room in the center of a specific maze layout, a clue will be triggered:
- Clue ID: `labyrinth_hidden_message`
- Trigger: Finding the central hidden room
- Status: **Implemented**
- Log Integration: Creates enhanced logs with "anomaly_detected" and "signal_received" events

### Reality Fragment Code
When player enters the code "2517" by collecting symbols in that specific order:
- Clue ID: `labyrinth_reality_fragment` 
- Trigger: Entering code "2517" via symbol collection
- Status: **Implemented**
- Log Integration: Creates "pattern_found" log with cross-references to STARFIELD.EXE

### Additional Clues
- Maze walls in level 3 form a visual pattern that reveals coordinates
- Specific maze completion order reveals a hidden message in logs
- Status: **Implemented**
- Log Integration: Wall patterns are detected and logged with "structure_analysis" event type

### Log Viewer Integration
- Direct access to System Log Viewer from within LABYRINTH.EXE
- Enhanced log entries with meaningful data patterns for analysis
- Special event types for anomaly detection and pattern recognition
- Cross-references to other system components (STARFIELD.EXE, Terminal)

## How to Play

1. Navigate the maze using arrow keys or WASD
2. Collect symbols (displayed as characters like 2, 5, 1, 7)
3. Find the exit (â—Š) to advance to the next level
4. Pay attention to patterns in the maze walls
5. Look for special sequences in collected symbols

## UI/UX Enhancements

To improve player experience, the following enhancements have been planned:

### Visual Improvements
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Add a "fog of war" effect where only areas near the player are fully visible
- **Animation Effects**: Smooth transitions for symbol collection, level completion, and player movement
- **Improved Color Coding**: Enhanced contrast between different maze elements with customizable color schemes
- **Minimap Feature**: Optional small map in corner showing overall maze structure with player position

### Gameplay Enhancements
- **Difficulty Settings**: Allow players to choose between normal and hard modes
- **Breadcrumb Trail**: Optional visual indicator of the path the player has taken
- **Hint System**: Subtle visual cues that activate after several minutes on a level
- **Achievement System**: Rewards for completing levels under time limits or with special conditions

### Accessibility Features
- **Adjustable Text Size**: Allow players to increase the size of ASCII elements
- **High Contrast Mode**: Option for simpler visuals with greater contrast
- **Sound/Visual Toggle**: Allow players to choose between audio cues, visual cues, or both
- **Customizable Controls**: Remappable keyboard controls and improved touch controls for mobile

### UI Improvements
- **Enhanced Status Panel**: More informative status panel with clearer visual hierarchy
- **Context-Sensitive Help**: Quick help that appears based on player actions
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual representation of game completion progress
- **Dynamic Messages**: More responsive feedback system for player actions
