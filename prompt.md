I'm working on a retro 90s operating system themed ARG game called "MrHeadroom99". It is intended to have a functioning operating system running in javascript. The game will have mysteries for the player to solve in seemingly normal looking "programs".


I have a backlog.md file with prioritized tasks and an instructions.md file with detailed steps for the current task.

Please implement the task described in instructions.md as specified. The task involves creating a boot sequence for the OS. 

Don't add any features beyond what's in the instructions, and maintain the existing styling conventions. After implementation, explain what you've changed and how it works.

The project uses only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no external libraries or frameworks).
