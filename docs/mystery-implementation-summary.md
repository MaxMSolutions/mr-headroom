# Mystery System Implementation - Summary

This document outlines the implementation details for the Mystery System in the RetroOS project.

## Core Components Implemented

### 1. MysteryEngine

The core engine that manages the state and logic for the mystery narrative. It tracks:

- Discovered clues
- Maintenance window state
- Active patterns
- Path progress toward the three endings (alpha, beta, gamma)
- Available ending paths

Key methods:
- `getInstance()`: Get the singleton instance
- `isMaintenanceWindowActive()`: Check if a maintenance window is active
- `setMaintenanceWindowActive(active)`: Toggle maintenance window
- `hasDiscoveredRequiredCluesForEnding(endingPath)`: Check if player can trigger an ending
- `updatePathProgress(path, increment)`: Increase progress toward an ending path

### 2. Terminal Commands for Ending Triggers

Added three terminal commands to trigger the different endings:

- `execute_initiate_alpha`: Triggers the Alpha ending path (Truth)
- `execute_enter_mirror`: Triggers the Beta ending path (Partial revelation)
- `execute_breakout`: Triggers the Gamma ending path (Escape)

Each command:
- Verifies required clues are discovered
- Uses SaveManager to set game flags
- Provides appropriate feedback to the player
- For Gamma path, requires maintenance window to be active

### 3. SaveManager Integration

Extended SaveManager to support ending triggers:

- Added `endingTriggerEvent` to GameState
- Implemented `setGameFlag` method with proper TypeScript types
- Added ending path availability flags

### 4. Command Access

Added `guide` command to Terminal to provide access to the hint system.

## Implementation Notes

1. The Gamma ending can only be triggered during a maintenance window, adding a timing element to the puzzle.

2. Each ending has specific clue requirements that must be discovered before the path can be triggered.

3. The system maintains three distinct ending paths with different narrative contexts:
   - Alpha: Truth/Acceptance ending - Memory-focused
   - Beta: Liminal/Partial revelation ending - Simulation-focused
   - Gamma: Escape/Breach ending - System-focused

4. Path progress is updated as players discover clues, and endings become available when sufficient progress is made.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the GUIDE.EXE hint system implementation
2. Implement clue discovery events in various apps
3. Add file metadata system for hidden clues
4. Create ending sequence visualizations
5. Expand the PatternPuzzle system with in-game pattern recognition
