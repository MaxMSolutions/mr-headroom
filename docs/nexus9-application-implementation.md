# NEXUS-9 Application Implementation Specification

## Overview

The NEXUS-9 application represents a critical narrative element within the MRHEADROOM_DESCENT game. As the supercomputer responsible for running the reality simulation, NEXUS-9 serves as both a plot device and an interactive component that enhances player immersion and reveals key aspects of the game's mystery.

## Narrative Importance

NEXUS-9 is the core simulation engine that maintains the virtual reality in which the protagonist (Henry Hedrum/MRHEADROOM) exists. The discovery that NEXUS-9 is simulating reality itself—rather than simply being a computer within reality—forms one of the central revelations of the game's storyline.

Key narrative points:
- NEXUS-9 was created as a "reality engine" capable of simulating consciousness
- The protagonist gradually discovers they exist within this simulation
- Understanding and manipulating the NEXUS-9 system is necessary to achieve certain endings
- The computer represents the boundary between simulated existence and "true" reality

## User Interface Design

### Visual Style

The NEXUS-9 application should adhere to the game's retro-cyberpunk aesthetic with:
- Dark background with neon accents (primarily cyan and magenta)
- Terminal-like interface with monospaced fonts
- Scan lines and subtle CRT effects (respecting accessibility toggle)
- Animated elements suggesting active computation
- Occasional "glitches" that reveal deeper layers of the system

### Layout Components

1. **Header Section:**
   - NEXUS-9 logo and version identifier
   - System status indicator ("SIMULATION ACTIVE")
   - Security clearance level display
   - Current simulation timestamp

2. **Main Terminal Interface:**
   - Command input field with blinking cursor
   - Output display area with scrollable history
   - Command prompt with authorization level indicator
   - Response formatting with color-coded severity levels

3. **System Status Display:**
   - Reality coherence meter (animated)
   - Memory allocation statistics
   - Active process list with cryptic names
   - Resource utilization graphs

4. **Visualization Panel:**
   - Abstract representation of simulation processing
   - Dynamic data flow patterns
   - Glitch effects that occasionally reveal "true reality" fragments

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality

1. **Command Processing System:**
   - Accept text input from user
   - Process commands against a defined command list
   - Return appropriate responses based on command and current game state
   - Maintain command history accessible via up/down arrows

2. **Authentication Levels:**
   - DEFAULT: Basic system information only
   - USER: Limited diagnostic commands
   - ADMIN: System configuration access
   - SYSTEM: Full simulation control (never fully accessible)

3. **Progressive Disclosure:**
   - Interface reveals more functionality as player discovers clues
   - Command set expands based on game progression
   - Security clearance increases after specific puzzle solutions
   - Visual elements evolve to reflect the deteriorating simulation boundary

### Command Set

| Command | Description | Initial Access Level | Response Type |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| `help` | List available commands | DEFAULT | Command list filtered by access level |
| `status` | Display system status | DEFAULT | Basic system statistics |
| `info` | Display NEXUS-9 information | DEFAULT | Generic system description |
| `scan` | Scan simulation integrity | USER | Reality coherence report |
| `users` | List active users | USER | Shows MRHEADROOM and other entities |
| `processes` | List active processes | USER | Simulation maintenance processes |
| `logs` | Access system logs | ADMIN | Filtered logs based on discovered clues |
| `admin` | Attempt administrator login | USER | Authentication challenge |
| `reality_check` | Analyze reality parameters | ADMIN | Key narrative information |
| `breach` | Attempt to breach simulation | ADMIN | Triggers specific game events |
| `shutdown` | Shutdown simulation | SYSTEM | Always fails but provides narrative clues |

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure

```typescript
// src/apps/nexus9/index.ts
import Nexus9Window from './Nexus9Window';
export default Nexus9Window;

// src/apps/nexus9/types.ts
export interface Nexus9State {
  accessLevel: 'DEFAULT' | 'USER' | 'ADMIN' | 'SYSTEM';
  commandHistory: string[];
  systemStatus: {
    coherence: number;
    memoryUsage: number;
    activeProcesses: number;
    breachAttempts: number;
  };
  revealedClues: string[];
}

// src/apps/nexus9/Nexus9Window.tsx
// Main component implementation

// src/apps/nexus9/components/
// Terminal.tsx - Command terminal interface
// StatusDisplay.tsx - System status visualization
// VisualizationPanel.tsx - Abstract simulation display
// CommandProcessor.ts - Command handling logic
```

### Integration Points

1. **Game State Integration:**
   - Connect with SaveManager to track player progress
   - Check for discovered clues to determine access level
   - Update game state when specific commands are successfully executed

2. **Registry Integration:**
   - App registry entry in `src/apps/registry/index.ts`
   - Standard window definition with appropriate sizing
   - Specialized icon representing NEXUS-9

3. **Mystery Engine Integration:**
   - Trigger clue discovery events when certain commands are used
   - Modify PatternPuzzleSystem state based on interaction patterns
   - Influence ending path variables based on specific command sequences

## Narrative Integration

### Access Level Progression

1. **Initial Access (DEFAULT):**
   - Generic system information
   - Limited command set
   - No indication of reality simulation functionality

2. **After Finding Key Files (USER):**
   - More detailed system information
   - Hints about simulation parameters
   - Access to user logs showing "reality breaches"

3. **After Solving Main Puzzles (ADMIN):**
   - Direct references to reality simulation
   - Access to core system functions
   - Information about potential endings/escape paths

### Clue Integration

The NEXUS-9 app should reference or reveal:
- Connection to files found in the file system
- Cross-references to mini-game outcomes
- Information that complements terminal command discoveries
- Visual cues that match patterns found elsewhere

## Progressive Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Interface

1. Create window component with terminal interface
2. Implement simple command processing
3. Design basic UI layout and styling
4. Integrate with app registry and window manager

### Phase 2: Narrative Integration

1. Implement access level system tied to game progress
2. Add command responses that reveal story elements
3. Create visualization components with appropriate animations
4. Add glitch effects that reveal hidden information

### Phase 3: Puzzle Integration

1. Connect specific commands to puzzle solutions
2. Implement authentication challenges as mini-puzzles
3. Create visual cues that tie into the pattern puzzle system
4. Ensure commands can influence ending path variables

## Testing and Quality Assurance

1. **Command Processing Tests:**
   - Verify all commands produce appropriate responses
   - Test command history functionality
   - Ensure access levels properly restrict commands

2. **State Integration Tests:**
   - Verify app responds to game state changes
   - Test progressive disclosure based on clue discovery
   - Ensure puzzle solutions properly affect NEXUS-9 behavior

3. **Visual and UX Testing:**
   - Verify animations and effects work as expected
   - Test with accessibility mode enabled
   - Ensure text is readable on all supported themes

## Conclusion

The NEXUS-9 application provides a crucial interactive element that ties together the game's narrative threads. By implementing this component with attention to both functionality and storytelling, we enhance the player's immersion and provide a satisfying mechanism for revealing key aspects of the game's mystery.

The progressive nature of the interface ensures that players continue to discover new information as they explore, while the command-based interaction maintains the retro-computing aesthetic that defines the game's unique visual identity.
