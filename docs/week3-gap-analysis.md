# Week 3 Gap Analysis: Mini-Games & Clue Integration

This document outlines the current state of Week 3 deliverables and identifies gaps that need to be addressed to complete the week's goals.

## Overall Status

Week 3 focuses on implementing two mini-games (STARFIELD.EXE and LABYRINTH.EXE) and integrating them with the clue system. The foundation has been laid with the GameBase class and basic window components, but significant implementation work remains.

## Completed Components

1. **Game Framework**
   - ✅ GameBase abstract class with event logging and clue discovery hooks
   - ✅ Game registry entries for both games
   - ✅ File system entries for both games
   - ✅ Basic window components for games

2. **StarfieldWindow Component**
   - ✅ Basic component structure with game header
   - ✅ Initial StarfieldEngine class skeleton
   - ✅ CSS styling for the game

3. **LogViewer Application**
   - ✅ Basic component structure
   - ✅ UI for viewing and filtering logs

4. **Integration with Save System**
   - ✅ Game logs storage in SaveManager
   - ✅ Clue discovery mechanism

5. **Tests**
   - ✅ Basic test structure for Starfield game

## Gaps to Completion

### 1. STARFIELD.EXE Implementation

- ❌ **Core Game Engine**:
  - The StarfieldEngine needs full implementation of game loop functionality
  - Ship movement, enemy spawning, collision detection need to be implemented
  - Projectile handling and scoring system need to be completed

- ❌ **Game Rendering**:
  - Canvas rendering of game elements is not yet implemented
  - Star pattern that encodes clues needs to be fully implemented

- ❌ **Memory Dump Feature**:
  - While there's a placeholder for the memory dump trigger at 15953 points, the actual implementation needs to be completed
  - The clue content and encoding needs to be properly defined

### 2. LABYRINTH.EXE Implementation

- ❌ **Game Engine**:
  - The LabyrinthGame class has minimal implementation
  - No maze generation algorithm is implemented
  - No player movement or game state management is implemented
  - Symbol collection and special combinations are not yet coded

- ❌ **Game Rendering**:
  - ASCII art rendering for the maze is not implemented
  - UI for showing collected symbols and level information is missing

- ✅ **Clue Integration**:
  - Implemented clue triggers based on game events
  - Added symbol collection sequence ("2517") that triggers clue discovery
  - Created secret room detection with special messages and log entries

### 3. Log Viewer Enhancements

- ✅ **Access Methods**:
  - Added Log Viewer visibility in the system menu
  - Created LOGVIEW.EXE executable in the system directory
  - Added 'logs' and 'logview' Terminal commands
  - Added direct Log Viewer access button in LABYRINTH.EXE

- ✅ **Game Log Integration**:
  - Enhanced LabyrinthEngine to emit structured, detailed logs
  - Added special log events for anomaly detection and pattern analysis
  - Implemented cross-references between game systems in log data

### 4. Cross-Game References

- ❌ **Narrative Integration**:
  - Cross-references between games are not yet implemented
  - References to files or terminal commands that can decode game outputs are missing
  - Star patterns in STARFIELD.EXE that reveal coordinates for LABYRINTH.EXE need implementation

### 5. Testing

- ❌ **Test Coverage**:
  - While there's a basic test file for Starfield, it has placeholder assertions
  - No tests for LABYRINTH.EXE exist
  - Integration tests for clue discovery are missing

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Complete STARFIELD.EXE Core Implementation**
   - Finish game engine functionality
   - Implement ship movement, enemy spawning, projectile handling
   - Add scoring system with special trigger at 15953 points
   - Implement star pattern encoding for clues

2. **Complete LABYRINTH.EXE Implementation** (Partially Completed)
   - ✅ Implemented Log Viewer integration
   - ✅ Added clue discovery through symbols and secret rooms
   - ✅ Enhanced game logs with detailed event information
   - ❌ Complete maze generation algorithm
   - ❌ Finalize player movement and collision detection

3. **Enhance Log Viewer** (Partially Completed)
   - ✅ Improved game log integration with the Log Viewer
   - ✅ Added enhanced logging for clue discovery and pattern analysis
   - ❌ Add special formatting for memory dumps and anomalies

4. **Cross-Game Integration**
   - Add references between games
   - Create terminal commands for decoding game outputs
   - Implement shared narrative elements

5. **Testing**
   - Complete test suite for STARFIELD.EXE
   - Create tests for LABYRINTH.EXE
   - Add integration tests for clue discovery

## Conclusion

While the foundation has been laid for Week 3 deliverables, significant implementation work remains for both games and their integration with the clue system. The highest priority should be completing the core game mechanics for STARFIELD.EXE, followed by LABYRINTH.EXE, and then enhancing the Log Viewer to display game logs effectively. Cross-game references and comprehensive testing should follow these core implementations.
